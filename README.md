So, should businesses use Wikipedia to drive traffic, leads and sales to their website? <br>

The answer is a huge YES! <br>

A Wikipedia page for your company will increase your recognition and notability and add credibility to your business. This is because Wikipedia is the crowd-sourced online encyclopedia that covers everything from the history behind Shotgun to toilet paper orientation. But it is also a platform where you can learn about Apple, Elon Musk or Intel. <br>

However, you do not need to be a multi-billion-dollar company to benefit from Wikipedia. It just is not for everyone. Should you hire a Wikipedia page creation agency to create a page for you? Read on to find out! <br>

1.	Easy SEO win <br>

2.	Provides traffic to your site <br>
To have decent traffic on your website, you should start being an active contributor to Wikipedia. Along with this, you should also keep improving on your existing article.

Let's say a client searches for your brand online. The more links that refer to your site, the more authoritative and legit you become in the eyes of that client. Now imagine having a page on a reputable site like Wikipedia. It will make your company look professional and successful. <br>

4.	Boosts your sales <br>
A Wikipedia page serves as a great way of converting visitors into customers. Since people use Wiki as a reference source, the website plays a massive role in making decisions for customers.
